RockPaperScissors.ipynbï¼š
Exercise 1 (20%): Name your file RockPaperScissors.ipynb. Write a program to play
Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The game will (1) ask you to enter Rock, Paper, or
Scissors, (2) randomly generates Rock, Paper, or Scissors and (3) determine whether it
is a win, tie or loss. The game will quit when you hit the first win. (hint: you can import the
random module from python by calling import random and use random.randint(1, 3)
to generate a random number 1, 2, or 3).
